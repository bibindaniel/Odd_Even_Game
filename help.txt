

	Hello Buddy! I'm Odden, your friendly opponent in the game. 

	Don't know or remember how to play this classic hand game? No worries, I got you covered! Now read carefully.

	Odds and Evens is a traditional hand game which was & is quite popular among kids & teens. 
	(DISCLAIMER: Doesn't mean adults can't play.)

	The gameplay rules are quite simple.

	You choose either Odds or Evens as your side. You can make the free choice. Odden will be satisfied with the other side! {^-^} 
	[Shhh! There's Even an Easter Egg Hidden!]

	As the game starts, you will start by entering a number from 0 to 9 first & Odden will then pick his number.

	In case you have trust issues with Odden, do remember he's not yet that artificially intelligent to pick his number after seeing yours.
	He will always pick random numbers. Silly Guy! {^-^}

	Game would calculate sum of both your numbers instantly.

	If the sum is even, Even Side gets the sum added to their score & if its odd, Odd Side gets the score.

	This would go on until any of these 2 events happen: 
	
	 	- When you both pick same number, game ends and Side with highest score WINS!

		- After 25 turns, whichever Side with highest score WINS!

	In case scores are leveled, it's a DRAW!

	As you know, it isn't a complex game. So HAPPY TIMEPASSING!
